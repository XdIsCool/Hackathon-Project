                <h3 id="timeline_titles">Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770):</h3>
                After the Seven Years war or more commonly known as the French and Indian war, Britain gained a huge
                debt.
                Finally, they have won the war, but the consequences were substantial. Britain had to tax their fellow
                colonists in the Americas, but rather well unfairly. These events led to another one which is quite well
                known in U.S. history, and it is called the Boston Massacre. The colonists were not pleased with the
                British
                troops presence and threw things like rocks, snowballs etc. It resulted in 5 people who died and 8
                wounded.
                The Boston Massacre is also known to be part of the spark to the American Revolution.

                <h3 id="timeline_titles"><u>The Midnight Ride (April 19, 1775):</u></h3>
                The British were supposedly marching towards Lexington to arrest two people, Samuel Adams and John
                Hancock.
                They were also going to head to Concord to destroy military supplies. Paul Revere now comes into play
                with
                the task to warn the people in Lexington. He reached their houses and delivered the message about the
                troops. Later on the militia were prepared to fight the British which came to be known as the Battle of
                Lexington and Concord.
                <br><br>
                <h3 id="timeline_titles"><u>Declaration of Independence(July 4, 1776):</u></h3>
                The colonists of America were hesitant upon the decision to separate themselves from the country of
                Britain.
                They decided upon voting if they should declare independence. Every state voted for independence except
                for
                New York that was abstaining. America later won the war with the help of France and officially declared
                independence. The group of people who worked on the Declaration were Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin
                Franklin,
                John Adams, John Hancock, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston.

                <h3 id="timeline_titles"><u>Constitution of the USA(March 9, 1789):</u></h3>
                During the early periods of the U.S. after the war, and after establishing a stable and fair government
                to protect its people, they needed good laws. The Constitution consisted of the Preamble which stated
                why it was made/purpose, and the Bill of Rights were basic rights that citizens of the U.S. had. Later
                on as the U.S. progressed, they added more amendments(rights)in the document.

                <h3 id="timeline_titles"><u>Alexander Hamiltion and Thomas Jefferson:</u></h3>
                George Washington became the first president of the United States of America in 1789. He had a set of
                advisors or cabinet and it had two well known figures in American History. These well known people are
                known as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. However, they actually hated each other and were
                rivals. They polarized politics and created parties known as the Federalists & Democratic-Republicans.
                The Federalists wanted a strong and central government because the citizens could not be trusted. They
                supported Great Britain as a strong nation and the Federalists were based on business and trade. The
                Democratic-Republicans wanted to be based on agriculture and supported France. They wanted the states to
                be stronger than the central government.

                <h3 id="timeline_titles"><u>Xyz Affair:</u></h3>
                During the French Revolution, the U.S. made a trading agreement with Britain. France saw this as
                betrayal so they sent out people to impress U.S. ships. John Adams sent diplomats to France to discuss
                the situation. However, France sent XYZ agents to speak to the diplomats and they said that France
                requires a lot of money which outraged America greatly. This led to somewhat of a war or quasi war with
                France, but it ended quickly. This became known as the XYZ Affair and it led to incidents like the Alien
                and Sedition acts.
